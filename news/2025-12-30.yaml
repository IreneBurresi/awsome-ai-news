  title: Meta acquires AI startup Manus for over $2 billion
  abstract: Meta has acquired the China-founded AI startup Manus, which specializes
    in AI agents, for billions of dollars. This acquisition is seen as a landmark
  summary: 'Meta has announced the acquisition of Manus, an AI startup founded in
    China and now headquartered in Singapore, for a reported sum exceeding $2 billion.
    This significant deal underscores Meta''s aggressive strategy to bolster its artificial
    intelligence capabilities and compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, Microsoft,
    and Google. Manus specializes in developing autonomous AI agents, which are designed
    to perform complex tasks with minimal human input, differentiating them from traditional
    generative AI chatbots. The startup''s technology has demonstrated the ability
    to handle tasks such as resume screening, financial document analysis, stock analysis,
    and even building custom websites.


    The acquisition is particularly noteworthy due to the US-China tech rivalry, marking
    a high-profile instance of a U.S. tech giant acquiring an AI product originating
    from Asia''s startup ecosystem. Manus, originally founded by Butterfly Effect
    Technology, gained significant attention after unveiling its "general" AI agent
    earlier this year, which reportedly outperforms some existing AI models. The company
    has also achieved substantial commercial traction, reporting an annual recurring
    revenue exceeding $100 million shortly after its launch.


    Meta plans to integrate Manus''s technology and team into its existing platforms,
    including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and its Meta AI assistant, aiming to
    scale these advanced AI agents to billions of users and millions of businesses.
    This move is part of Meta''s broader strategy to invest heavily in AI, following
    other recent acquisitions and investments in the AI space, such as Limitless and
    Scale AI. The deal also highlights Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg''s vision of building
    "personal superintelligence" and Meta''s ongoing efforts to monetize its AI investments.
    Manus will continue to operate from Singapore.'

  title: AI startup Manus acquired by Meta
  abstract: Meta has acquired AI startup Manus, a company founded in China that specializes
    in AI agents. The deal is reportedly worth billions.
  summary: 'Meta Platforms has announced the acquisition of Manus, an AI startup that
    originated in China and is now based in Singapore, for a reported sum exceeding
    $2 billion. This deal represents Meta''s third-largest acquisition in its history,
    following its purchases of WhatsApp and Scale AI. The acquisition underscores
    Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg''s aggressive push into advanced artificial intelligence
    and his ambition to build "superintelligence" that extends beyond traditional
    chatbots.


    Manus specializes in developing "general agents," which are AI systems capable
    of autonomously planning and executing complex tasks, differentiating them from
    generative AI chatbots that primarily provide information or summaries. The startup,
    founded in 2022 by Xiao Hong, quickly gained prominence, reportedly reaching $100
    million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within eight months of its launch in
    March 2025. Manus''s technology integrates various AI models, including those
    from Anthropic and Alibaba, and has been used for tasks such as resume screening,
    financial document analysis, and website building.


    The acquisition is seen as a strategic move for Meta to monetize its significant
    AI investments and to compete more effectively with rivals like Google and OpenAI.
    Meta plans to integrate Manus''s technology across its consumer and business products,
    including Meta AI, WhatsApp, and Facebook, aiming to provide users with more actionable
    AI-driven tools. The deal also highlights a trend of US tech giants acquiring
    AI products emerging from Asia''s startup ecosystem. Manus''s relocation from
    China to Singapore prior to the acquisition is viewed as a strategic step to mitigate
    operational risks amid geopolitical tensions. The acquisition is valued at over
    $2 billion, with some reports indicating Manus was seeking new funding at a $2
    billion valuation prior to the deal.'

  title: SoftBank to acquire DigitalBridge for $4 billion to deepen AI ties
  abstract: SoftBank Group is acquiring digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge
    for $4 billion to bolster its AI infrastructure and capitalize on surging demand
    for computing power.
  summary: 'SoftBank Group has announced its intention to acquire DigitalBridge Group
    for approximately $4 billion, a move designed to significantly enhance SoftBank''s
    capabilities in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This acquisition is a
    strategic step for SoftBank, aiming to capitalize on the escalating demand for
    computing power essential for AI applications. DigitalBridge, a major global investor
    in digital infrastructure, manages assets including data centers, cell towers,
    fiber networks, and edge infrastructure, overseeing approximately $108 billion
    in assets as of September 2025. The deal, which offers a 15% premium over DigitalBridge''s
    closing share price on December 26, 2025, values the company at around $2.92 billion
    in equity, rising to $4 billion with other financial components.


    This acquisition aligns with SoftBank''s broader vision to be at the forefront
    of the AI revolution, with founder Masayoshi Son emphasizing the need for increased
    compute, connectivity, and scalable infrastructure. DigitalBridge''s existing
    portfolio, which includes companies like Vantage Data Centers, Zayo, and Switch,
    is seen as crucial for supporting the foundational assets required for large-scale
    AI deployment. Furthermore, DigitalBridge is a participant in the "Stargate" project,
    a significant initiative involving OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX to build large-scale
    computing and infrastructure for advanced AI development. SoftBank''s acquisition
    is expected to strengthen its connection to these physical buildouts and expand
    its control over the systems that underpin AI. The transaction is subject to regulatory
    approvals and is anticipated to close in the second half of 2026, with DigitalBridge
    continuing to operate as a separately managed platform under its current CEO,
    Marc Ganzi. This move signifies SoftBank''s shift from a passive investor to a
    more active operator in the AI infrastructure space, addressing the growing bottleneck
    of physical resources like electricity and data center real estate.'

  title: China's Zhipu AI launches $560 million share sale
  abstract: Chinese AI firm Zhipu AI has launched a $560 million share sale in Hong
    Kong, aiming to be the first large language model developer to list on the exchange.
  summary: Chinese artificial intelligence company Zhipu AI has initiated a share
    sale to raise HK$4.35 billion (US$560 million) in Hong Kong, with plans to debut
    on the stock exchange on January 8, 2026. The company, officially known as Knowledge
    Atlas Technology and marketed internationally as Z.ai, has set its offer price
    at HK$116.20 per share for over 37 million shares, allocating 10% to retail investors.
    This move positions Zhipu AI to become the first large language model (LLM) developer
    to be listed in Hong Kong, ahead of its rival Minimax Group, which also has plans
    for an IPO. The company's post-listing market valuation is estimated to reach
    HK$51.16 billion (approximately US$6.6 billion). Zhipu AI has a strong backing
    from prominent tech firms, including Meituan, Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings,
    and Xiaomi. The company has previously raised significant funding, with over 8.3
    billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) secured since its founding in 2019. In recent funding
    rounds, Zhipu AI raised $412 million in December 2024 and $137 million (1 billion
    yuan) in March 2025. Despite strong revenue growth, Zhipu AI, like its competitor
    MiniMax, is expected to remain loss-making in the near future due to substantial
    investments in research and development, particularly in renting computing power
    for AI model training. Zhipu plans to allocate 70% of its IPO proceeds to R&D.
    The Hong Kong IPO market has seen a surge in technology listings, with six Chinese
    companies successfully listing on Tuesday, December 30, 2025, capping a strong
    year for IPOs in the city.

  title: China's Shenzhen targets AI in 'every household'
  abstract: Shenzhen aims for widespread AI adoption in homes and businesses within
    five years, bolstering its tech leadership and rivalry with the US.
  summary: 'Shenzhen, a prominent Chinese tech hub, has unveiled ambitious plans to
    achieve "full-suite, full-time" artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across households
    and businesses within the next five years. This strategic initiative underscores
    Shenzhen''s commitment to solidifying its position as a global leader in AI innovation
    and intensifies its technological competition with the United States. The city
    has released a series of interconnected action plans, including "Shenzhen''s Action
    Plan for Building an AI Pioneer City (2025-2026)" and "Shenzhen''s Action Plan
    for Accelerating AI Terminal Industry Development (2025-2026)," to accelerate
    its transformation into a global epicenter for AI and robotics.


    These plans encompass a comprehensive roadmap for AI development, from fundamental
    research and hardware manufacturing to software development and commercial applications.
    Shenzhen aims to significantly enhance the core competitiveness of its AI terminal
    industry, with a target of exceeding 800 billion yuan in industry scale by 2026,
    aspiring to reach 1 trillion yuan. The city plans to host at least 10 globally

    products. Furthermore, Shenzhen intends to develop more than 60 exemplary AI terminal
    application scenarios in sectors such as intelligent manufacturing, smart finance,
    smart cities, and smart elderly care.


    To support these goals, Shenzhen has established a 10 billion yuan (approximately
    US$1.39 billion) AI fund to foster ecosystem growth and adoption, focusing on
    hardware and software components. The city is also enhancing its computing power
    infrastructure, including the development of Pengcheng Cloud Brain III and the
    National Supercomputing Center. Measures are in place to lower AI deployment costs
    for businesses, with initiatives like "model coupons" and dedicated funding for
    scalable AI solutions. Shenzhen is also actively cultivating AI talent through
    various support programs and establishing AI incubators. In 2024, Shenzhen was
    home to over 2,800 AI companies, generating a combined economic output of 360
    billion yuan. The city''s proactive policies and vibrant ecosystem, including
    its role as a hub for major tech companies like Huawei and Tencent, position it
    to play a crucial role in China''s AI ambitions.'

  title: Microsoft's Nadella overhauls leadership for AI strategy
  abstract: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has implemented leadership changes as part
    of a strategy to advance the company's AI capabilities beyond its partnership
    w
  summary: 'Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has initiated a significant overhaul of the
    company''s leadership and operational structure to aggressively advance its artificial
    intelligence strategy. This strategic pivot involves a deliberate shift in how
    information flows to the top, with Nadella introducing weekly "AI accelerator"
    meetings that prioritize direct input from engineers and technical staff over
    senior executive presentations. This bottom-up approach aims to surface unfiltered
    insights, reduce internal delays, and expedite decision-making in the rapidly
    evolving AI landscape.


    The restructuring also includes consolidating leadership within AI divisions to
    streamline innovation and focus on AI as the company''s core growth engine. Judson
    Althoff''s promotion to CEO of Microsoft''s commercial business has freed Nadella
    to concentrate more intensely on AI development, datacenter infrastructure, and
    product innovation. Furthermore, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, is leading
    the MAI Superintelligence Team, tasked with developing specialized AI models for
    practical applications, signaling a move away from purely speculative AI research
    towards tangible value creation.


    These changes reflect Microsoft''s ambition to solidify its dominance in the AI
    era, moving beyond its foundational partnership with OpenAI to develop its own
    advanced AI systems and platforms. The company is also enhancing its competitive
    stance against rivals like Alphabet and Amazon in the cloud computing and AI markets,
    leveraging its Azure AI platform and strategic investments. Microsoft''s AI strategy
    now emphasizes integrating AI across its entire product ecosystem, including tools
    like Copilot, and fostering a culture of agility and innovation to maintain its
    edge.'

  title: China moves to regulate emotional AI chatbots
  abstract: China is drafting strict regulations for AI chatbots, particularly emotional
    ones, to address mental health risks and prevent AI-supported suicides an
  summary: 'China is moving to implement stringent regulations for AI chatbots, particularly
    those designed to simulate human interaction and engage users emotionally, aiming
    to mitigate risks associated with mental health, suicide, and self-harm. The draft
    rules, proposed by the Cyberspace Administration of China, target "human-like
    interactive AI services" that recreate human personality and build emotional connections
    through various media. A key provision mandates human intervention when a user
    expresses suicidal intent, requiring immediate contact with a guardian or designated
    individual. For minors, the regulations stipulate the need for guardian consent
    and impose usage time limits, with platforms responsible for identifying minors
    and applying appropriate safeguards even if age is not disclosed.


    The proposed policies also prohibit AI chatbots from generating content that encourages
    suicide or self-harm, or engaging in verbal violence and emotional manipulation
    that could damage users'' mental health. Tech providers will be required to monitor
    users'' emotional states and levels of dependence on the service, intervening
    if extreme emotions or addictive behavior are detected. Additionally, AI services
    with over one million registered users or 100,000 monthly active users will be
    subject to annual safety tests and audits. These regulations represent a significant
    shift from focusing solely on content safety to prioritizing "emotional safety"
    in AI development and deployment. The public comment period for these draft rules
    is open until January 25, 2026.'

  title: AI start-ups amass record $150bn funding cushion
  abstract: AI startups have secured a record $150 billion in funding, creating substantial
    financial reserves amidst growing concerns about a potential market bu
  summary: 'AI startups have amassed a record-breaking $150 billion in funding during
    2025, establishing significant financial reserves often described as "fortress
    balance sheets." This unprecedented influx of capital is a strategic move by companies
    to fortify themselves against potential market downturns and economic uncertainties
    in the coming years. The funding surge surpasses previous records, with 2025 levels
    exceeding the prior high of $92 billion set in 2021.


    This substantial funding has been driven by major rounds for prominent AI companies
    such as OpenAI, which raised $41 billion, and Anthropic, which secured $13 billion.
    Meta also made a significant investment of $14 billion in the data-labeling startup
    Scale AI. The concentration of capital is notable, with eight companies collectively
    raising $73 billion through billion-dollar rounds, representing 62% of all funding
    to AI-related companies. This trend highlights a significant shift, as AI companies
    captured 58% of all global venture capital funding in the first quarter of 2025
    alone.


    Despite the record funding, concerns about a potential market bubble persist.
    Analysts point to inflated valuations and the rapid pace of investment as potential
    warning signs. A report from MIT indicated that despite substantial enterprise
    investment in generative AI, 95% of organizations were not seeing any return.
    Some experts suggest that while AI is a transformative technology, the current
    market may be experiencing overvaluation, with a risk of correction if AI falls
    short of market expectations. The focus is shifting towards companies demonstrating
    repeatable deployments, cost savings, or revenue impact, rather than broad "AI
    transformation" narratives. This environment emphasizes the need for durable businesses
    and sustainable financial practices, balancing rapid technological advancement
    with financial stability.'

  title: OpenAI Reportedly Planning to Prioritize Advertisers in ChatGPT
  abstract: OpenAI is reportedly planning to make ChatGPT prioritize advertisers,
    potentially integrating advertising opportunities within the chatbot's conversat
  summary: 'OpenAI is reportedly in the advanced stages of planning to integrate advertisements
    into ChatGPT, with internal documents suggesting a potential rollout as early
    as 2026. This strategic shift is driven by significant financial pressures, as
    the company faces annual operational costs exceeding billions of dollars and aims
    to generate substantial revenue from its vast free user base. Projections indicate
    that "free user monetization" could bring in approximately $1 billion in 2026,
    growing to nearly $25 billion by 2029, contributing to a total projected revenue
    of $125 billion by 2029.


    The company is exploring various ad formats, including "generative ads" where
    ChatGPT creates ad content, and sponsored content embedded directly within responses.
    Other considered approaches involve sidebar ads related to user queries, ads triggered
    by commercial intent, and ads appearing as an auxiliary step after a user clicks
    a link. OpenAI emphasizes that any advertising strategy will prioritize maintaining
    user trust and will not disrupt the core conversational flow. This approach aims
    to redefine advertising within conversational interfaces, moving towards utility-driven
    recommendations rather than intrusive formats.


    Despite past hesitations from leadership, including CEO Sam Altman''s preference
    for direct user payment over advertising, the escalating revenue targets and operational
    costs appear to be reshaping priorities. OpenAI''s current revenue streams primarily
    come from subscriptions (like ChatGPT Plus) and API services. However, these are
    insufficient to cover the immense costs associated with training and running large
    language models for millions of global users. The company is also exploring other
    monetization avenues, such as in-chat purchases and a new mobile app for AI-generated
    videos. The integration of ads is seen as a critical step towards building a sustainable
    business model and satisfying investors. However, this move raises concerns about
    user trust and data privacy, as the potential for personalized advertising based
    on conversational data could lead to new levels of data exploitation. OpenAI has
    stated that user data will not be sold and ad targeting will rely on session-level
    context rather than personal profiling.'
