    Manus, founded in China in 2022 and later relocating its headquarters to Singapore,
    has developed AI agents capable of performing complex, end-to-end tasks autonomously,
    such as market research, coding, data analysis, and website creation, differentiating
    itself from traditional chatbots. The startup has demonstrated rapid growth, achieving
    an annual recurring revenue of over $100 million within eight months of its launch,
    and has processed over 147 trillion tokens and created more than 80 million virtual
    computers. The acquisition is considered one of the most high-profile instances
    of a U.S. tech giant acquiring an AI product from Asia's startup ecosystem and
    highlights Meta's aggressive investment strategy in AI to compete with industry
    leaders like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. Meta plans to continue operating Manus
    as a standalone service while integrating its technology, and the Manus team will
    join Meta's AI divisions. This move is part of Meta's broader AI overhaul under
    CEO Mark Zuckerberg, including the formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs and
    previous AI-related acquisitions and investments. The acquisition also comes amid
    heightened U.S.-China tech competition, with Manus reportedly severing ties to
