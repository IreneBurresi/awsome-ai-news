      <title>Russia-Ukraine Conflict Continues into 2026</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has continued into 2026, marked by significant escalations over New Year's Eve. Russia claimed that Ukrainian drone strikes on a hotel and cafe in the occupied village of Khorly, Kherson region, killed at least 24 people and injured over 50 on New Year's Eve. Russian officials stated that three drones struck the location, with one carrying an incendiary mixture that caused a fire. Russia has accused Ukraine of deliberately targeting civilians, labeling the incident a "war crime". However, Ukraine has not commented on this specific claim, and the incident could not be independently verified by all sources. In parallel, Ukraine reported that Russia launched over 200 attack drones targeting energy and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine on New Year's night, with 176 drones reportedly downed or jammed, but 24 striking 15 locations.
Adding another layer to the geopolitical landscape, North Korea's deepening military cooperation with Russia has become increasingly evident. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised troops fighting alongside Russia in Ukraine, referring to them as the "greatest strength" and "pride" of the nation, and highlighting the "invincible alliance" between Pyongyang and Moscow. Reports suggest North Korea has sent over 10,000 troops and conventional weapons to support Russia's war efforts, with thousands of casualties estimated. In exchange, North Korea is believed to be receiving financial assistance, advanced military technology, and vital supplies from Russia.
In a separate development, Ukraine's military intelligence announced that they staged the death of Denis Kapustin, a Russian fighter leading the Russian Volunteer Corps, to prevent his assassination ordered by Russian special forces. Kapustin, who had carried out cross-border raids into Russia, appeared via video link after his supposed death, with Ukrainian intelligence stating they preserved his life and identified those involved in the plot, even claiming to have received the $500,000 bounty Russia had offered for his killing. This operation bears resemblance to a previous incident in 2018 where a Russian journalist faked his death with Ukrainian assistance.
**Key Points:**
- Russia accused Ukraine of a New Year's Eve drone strike on a hotel and cafe in occupied Kherson, claiming 24 deaths and over 50 injuries, while Ukraine reported widespread Russian drone attacks on its infrastructure.
- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lauded troops fighting with Russia in Ukraine, emphasizing the "invincible alliance" and indicating continued military cooperation between the two nations.
- Ukraine's military intelligence revealed they staged the death of a Russian anti-Kremlin fighter, Denis Kapustin, to thwart a Russian assassination plot and capture those involved.
